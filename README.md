2. In the command-line navigate to the root of the project folder.
3. Enter `npm install`
4. In the command-line navigate to the server folder.
5. Enter `node index.js`
6. Open two tabs in your browser, then navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) in each tab.
7. You should now see both users are connected to the Node server.
8. Send some messages to the server and observe them in the other browser tab.
